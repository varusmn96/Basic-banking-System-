Hello connections,

"I am pleased to share that I have completed Task-1 of my internship as a Web Development and Designing Intern at  The Sparks Foundation Undergraduate Rotational Internship Program in April 2023.  #gripapril2023 #Gripapril23 #Gripapril2023

The project I worked on is a Basic Banking System website that enables customers to transfer money to each other.



For this project, I utilized HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap technologies and developed it using Visual Studio Code.
